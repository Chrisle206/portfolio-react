## Description

This is a personal project I created using React! It features other work I have done with projects I am proud to showcase! The link below leads to my portfolio homepage where people are able to get to know me and much more! In this project, I used a nav bar to divide sections of the website. The portfolio is far from finished and more Projects will be added in the Future! I learned how to use React, the javascript library to help develop the user-interface for frontend.
